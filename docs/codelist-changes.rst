Potential Changes: Codelists
============================

This table curates known potential changes to codeslists in the IATI Standard. 

It is presented to provide context and support to those interested in the direction of the IATI Standard, it is not intended as a backlog of items that will be implemented.  
For potential changes to be considered, a proposal is required. 
A proposal can consist of one or several potential changes, but requires clear rationale and impact assessment before any consideration.  

At present, the IATI Secretariat will maintain this log for public access. Discussions, considerations, and ideas around potential changes for the 
IATI Standard are expected to take place in online and other fora, to ensure relevant stakeholders and use cases are clearly articulated and considered.
