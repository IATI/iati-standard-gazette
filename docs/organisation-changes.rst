Potential Changes: Organisation Standard
=============================================

This table curates known potential changes for the IATI Organisation Standard. 

It is provided to give context and support to anyone interested in the future direction of the IATI Standard. It should not be interpreted as a backlog of items that will definitely be implemented.

For potential changes to be considered, a proposal is required. A proposal can consist of one or several potential changes, but requires clear rationale and impact assessment before any consideration.  

At present, the IATI Secretariat will maintain this log for public access. Discussions, considerations, and ideas around potential changes for the 
IATI Standard are expected to take place in online and other fora, to ensure relevant stakeholders and use cases are clearly articulated and considered.
